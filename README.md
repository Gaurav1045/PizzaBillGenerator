# Pizza Bill Generator üçï

A simple **Pizza Bill Generator** built using Core Java. This application allows users to order a pizza, customize it with extra cheese and toppings, choose a takeaway option, and generate a detailed bill based on the order.

## Features
- **Pizza Types**: Choose between Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian pizzas.
- **Add-ons**: Option to add extra cheese and extra toppings.
- **Takeaway Option**: Select takeaway with an additional charge.
- **Bill Generation**: Displays a breakdown of the selected items and calculates the total cost.

## Key Concepts
- **OOP Principles**: Uses inheritance, method overriding, and encapsulation.
- **Modular Design**: Separate classes for basic and deluxe pizzas.
- **Customization**: Flexible options for modifying orders.

## Class Structure
- `Pizza.java`: The base class that handles pizza attributes (price, cheese, toppings, takeaway).
- `DeluxePizza.java`: Inherits from `Pizza`, automatically includes extra cheese and toppings.
- `PizzaMain.java`: The main class where users interact with the system and generate the bill.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pizza-bill-generator.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
3. Compile and run the `PizzaMain.java` file:

    java PizzaMain
    ```
4. Follow the prompts to select pizza type, add extras, and view the final bill.
