# Pizza Bill Generator üçï

A simple **Pizza Bill Generator** built using Core Java. This application allows users to order a pizza, customize it with extra cheese and toppings, choose a takeaway option, and generate a detailed bill based on the order.

## Features
- **Pizza Selection**: Choose between Vegetarian and Non-Vegetarian pizzas.
- **Pizza Types**: Regular and Deluxe options available.
- **Customizations**: Option to add extra cheese and extra toppings.
- **Takeaway Option**: Select takeaway with an additional charge.
- **Bill Generation**: Displays a detailed breakdown of the selected items and calculates the total cost.

## Key Concepts
- **OOP Principles**: Demonstrates inheritance, method overriding, and encapsulation.
- **Modular Design**: Separate classes for basic and deluxe pizzas.
- **Dynamic Input Handling**: Allows users to select pizza by number and automatically determines veg/non-veg options.

## Class Structure
- `Pizza.java`: The base class that manages pizza attributes (e.g., price, cheese, toppings, takeaway).
- `DeluxePizza.java`: Inherits from `Pizza`, and automatically includes extra cheese and toppings.
- `PizzaMain.java`: The main class that interacts with the user to generate the bill.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gaurav1045/pizza-bill-generator.git
